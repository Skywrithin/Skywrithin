### Hello, I'm Kaleb ðŸ‘‹

Experienced with JavaScript and Ruby, from front-end to server-side frameworks. My passion is in new technology, and right now it seems everything new is on the front-end. That is my current focus, though I can learn quickly and adapt to new environments.

I recently graduated from Penn Foster and went on to complete the software engineering course at the Flatirons School. Now I create projects with new and complex technologies and concepts.
